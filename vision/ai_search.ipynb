We may earn an affiliate commission from links.No matter your best efforts, sometimes developing (and then figuring out how to get rid of) dark spots on your face, otherwise known as hyperpigmentation is inevitable. “Dark spots occur when the skin produces excess melanin, the natural brown pigment that gives our skin color,” says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Michele Green.', '“The exact reason why dark spots appear ranges from acne scars to excessive sun exposure to aging to nutritional deficiencies. However, most dark spots are a result of sun exposure.”At-Home Dark Spot TreatmentsThe Expert-Approved Serum: SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic, $182The Gentle Exfoliant: Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Treatment, $85The Retinol: SkinMedica Age Defense Retinol Complex .25, $64The Daily SPF: EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46, $41The Buzzy Serum: Topicals Faded Serum, $38The Supercharged Peel: Dr.', 'Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Universal Daily Peel, $92The Brightening Serum: Ourself Daily Dark Spot Intercept, $260In this sectionWhat are dark spots?Types of dark spots—and why they occurWhich skin types are most prone to developing dark spots?Is it possible to get rid of dark spots entirely?How to get rid of dark spots on darker skin tones?What treatments help get rid of dark spots?Meet the Experts“When your skin is exposed to the sun, its natural reaction is to produce melanin, which helps to block UV radiation from further damaging our DNA and skin. This is often why, when we go into the sun for prolonged periods, our skin gets tanned,” she says. “It is also the reason why individuals with fair skin easily burn in the sun while those with darker skin complexions are less likely to get sunburned. Sometimes, the sun causes an uneven increase in melanin production.', 'This excess melanin gets clumped up and spills in between skin cells, giving the appearance of dark spots.”In short, dark spots are a result of hyperpigmentation. Green notes that most dark spots, such as sun or age spots are preventable with proper SPF protection and sun avoidance. But, if you notice a new spot that changes in size or color, it’s best to consult a board-certified dermatologist to rule out skin cancer. “Anything out of the ordinary, especially if you have fair skin or a family history of skin cancer, should be checked out. I recommend getting regular skin exams so nothing suspicious goes unnoticed,” Green says.', 'Once you’ve determined that a new freckle is harmless, it’s time to prevent and treat it through your at-home skin-care regimen.Below, dermatologists walk us through how to get rid of dark spots—from everyday sun protection to rejuvenating retinol treatments.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Always Apply SPF“Your first line of defense is always going to be sunscreen. Everyone should wear at least SPF 30 on their face daily and reapply every two hours if outside in the sun, or sitting next to a window,” notes Dr. Corey L. Hartman, founder of Skin Wellness Dermatology in Birmingham, Alabama.Green suggests the EltaMD UV Clear, dubbing it one of the best sunscreens out there. “This product is a lightweight oil-free face sunscreen that works well with all skin types, including acne-prone and sensitive skin,” she says.', '\"It is recommended by the Skin Cancer Foundation for daily use and also contains sodium hyaluronate and lactic acid which helps keep the skin hydrated and your pores clear.” Or, take your pick between La Roche-Posay’s Toleriane or Supergoop!’s Unseen, which pair sheer nourishment with ample SPF protection. Because our experts emphasize the need to apply sunscreen throughout the day, be sure to stock up on convenient formulas that make reapplication simple.', 'Habit’s mister is a lightweight spray formula that delivers UV protection and won’t mess up your makeup.EltaMDUV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46$41 DERMSTORE$41 AMAZONThis lightweight sunscreen has become a cult favorite, thanks to its broad-spectrum sun protection, along with its nourishing formula rich in lactic acid, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid to keep skin hydrated.\\nLa Roche-PosayToleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer UV$25 $19 AMAZONCeramide-3, niacinamide, glycerin, and La Roche Posay’s signature Thermal Spring Water create a skin-loving broad-spectrum SPF 30.\\nSupergoop!Unseen Sunscreen SPF 40$38 DERMSTORE$38 NORDSTROM$38 SEPHORAKnown for its transparent finish, this sunscreen contains red algae, frankincense, and a meadow foam seed complex to protect against blue light, make skin more resilient, and boost hydration levels.\\nHabitN°41 Mister$30 SEPHORA$30 HABITPerfect for those who wish to spritz on their SPF rather than rub it in, an herbal blend of geranium flower, rosemary leaf, and lavender oils work together to add antioxidant protection, tone skin, and reduce inflammation.\\nConsider Antioxidant-Rich Products“You also want to make sure you are using skin-care products with antioxidants, which are essential to helping reduce free radicals that can lead to hyperpigmentation,” says Hartman.', 'Consider vitamins A, C, and E, as well as ferulic acid, resveratrol, and niacinamide. Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Alexis Stephens is a fan of Eadem’s Milk Marvel for fading post-acne dark marks. “The unique formula also helps to prevent future hyperpigmentation and gently resurface the skin. It is uniquely formulated with the\\xa0key ingredients niacinamide, encapsulated vitamin C, amber algae and enzymes.” Stephens also likes the Isdin Sunisdin sun capsules to “help skin\\xa0fight photoaging and the pro-pigmentation UV rays”—along with boosting overall radiance and elasticity.', 'Otherwise, experts recommend the SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic again and again for its environmental protection, or the cosmetic chemist-formulated BeautyStat Universal C to prevent signs of aging without oxidizing.SkinCeuticalsC E Ferulic$182 SKINCEUTICALSA mix of vitamin C, vitamin E, and ferulic acid come together to protect against free radicals and help treat discoloration.\\nBeautyStatUniversal C Skin Refiner$85 DERMSTORE$85 NORDSTROM$85 ULTAThis formula is the world’s first 20% vitamin C serum that contains a stabilized form of the gold standard ingredient.

Take one pill once a day in the morning with plenty of water.', 'You should start to notice results within two weeks.\\nEADEMMilk Marvel Dark Spot Serum$68 SEPHORAFormulated specifically for skin of color, encapsulated vitamin C, niacinamide, amber algae, as well as papaya and pineapple enzymes help to curb hyperpigmentation fast.\\nReach for Retin-A or Retinol“It’s also important to get into the habit of gently exfoliating the skin\\xa0to remove dead skin cells that are often harboring excess pigment. This can be done by using a topical retinoid product that both treats and fades hyperpigmentation,” explains Stephens. While Green says that retin-a (tretinoin) or retinoids are best, an ingredient that can be picked up by a beauty subscription service like Curology, retinol is the next best bet without a prescription.“Retinol is a weaker over-the-counter formula of retinoids and can provide similar benefits in reducing the appearance of dark spots, although it will typically take much longer,” Green explains.', 'Take your pick of SkinCeuticals’s Retinol 0.3, SkinMedica’s Retinol Complex .25, or CeraVe’s Skin Renewing serum to experience the restorative benefits of the oft-recommended ingredient.CurologyFuture-Proof Rx$60 CUROLOGYThis prescription-strength product is customized just for you—so your skin will be getting exactly what it needs.\\nSkinMedicaAge Defense Retinol Complex .25$64 DERMSTOREThe formula’s retinol is paired with the brand’s trademark PhytoShield Complex to help curb irritation while also enhancing skin texture.\\nSkinCeuticalsRetinol 0.3$78 SKINCEUTICALSIf you’re new to retinoids, this may be the product for you.', 'A concentration of 0.3% retinol is paired with soothing ingredients like bisabolol to prevent any bad side physical effects.\\nCeraVeSkin Renewing Retinol Serum$25 $23 AMAZON$27 ULTAEncapsulated retinol helps to fight discoloration and smooth out fine lines, while ceramides protect the skin barrier.\\nIncorporate Gentle ExfoliantsHartman suggests “a product with an exfoliating active ingredient, like AHA, to help remove the top surface layer of the skin to treat dark spots.” This category of exfoliants includes glycolic, mandelic, and lactic acids which Stephens says “helps to remove dead skin cells while moisturizing the skin.” If you’d prefer a serum formula, Sunday Riley’s Good Genes is a solid option packed with lactic acid to exfoliate and brighten, whereas Alpha-H’s glycolic acid-enriched formula is an excellent liquid exfoliant known to improve skin tone and texture overnight. Similarly, at-home peels might be worth incorporating for those unable to get a professional treatment.', 'Take options by M-61 or Dr. Dennis Gross’s peels, for example; these supercharged towelettes help reduce the look of discoloration through a cocktail of exfoliating acids.Alpha-HLiquid Gold with 5% Glycolic Acid$56 NORDSTROM$56 SEPHORAIt’s not called Liquid Gold for no reason.

Those interested in a dermatologist-approved solution should seriously consider Cyspera’s system that Hartman advocates for. “Cyspera is my first choice for patients dealing with hyperpigmentation, especially patients of color, as hyperpigmentation can be difficult to treat successfully in darker skin,” he details. “Its active ingredient, cysteamine, is an exclusive amino acid derivative that helps reduce pigment and is effective in treating all skin tones.” Or, there’s board-certified dermatologist Dr.', 'Shereene Idriss’s recently-launched brand, PillowtalkDerm, which features a Major Fade collection formulated, in part, based on her own experience treating melasma and discoloration.On the other hand, there are a few contemporary beauty labels making waves for their efficacious offerings. There is Topicals Faded serum which uses a blend of tranexamic acid, azelaic acid, and niacinamide to reduce the look of dark spots, patches, and post-acne scarring. Ourself’s brightening serum, on the other hand, is powered by the brand’s patented technology enriched by the likes of peptides and powerhouse brightening ingredients, alongside vitamin C and niacinamide to intercept the overproduction of new melanin and lighten existing spots. Or perhaps a patch approach works best for your regimen?', 'In that case, Hero Cosmetics recently launched a new and improved version of its Micropoint patches which deposits tranexamic acid, vitamin C, licorice root, and niacinamide onto dark spots through 395 micropoints to fade post-blemish marks.CysperaIntensive System$299 CYSPERAThis three-step system tackles even the most stubborn dark spots.

She reaches for the Bluestone Sunshields for extra protection. For the body, consider Lululemon’s shirt which offers UPF 40+ protection.', '“If possible, try to avoid going out for prolonged periods when the sun is at its strongest between 10 am and 4 pm.,” says Green, who adds that a wide-brimmed hat or sunglasses are a good choice to protect your eyes and scalp from the sun.Bluestone SunshieldsFull Lux Visor$68 NORDSTROMChoose from five metallic colors that will give your face complete physical protection from the sun.\\nLululemonUV Protection Running Long Sleeve Shirt$88 $64 LULULEMONOffering up to UPF 40+ protection, be sure to slip this shirt on before heading out to enjoy a day in the sun.\\nWhat are dark spots?Otherwise known as discoloration or hyperpigmentation, dark spots are any area of the skin that appear darker than the surrounding skin. “This is due to an excess production of melanin—the pigment responsible for skin color,” explains aesthetic physician Dr. Glenicia Nosworthy.Something else to note is that there are different types of dark spots—and they can all show up on the skin in various forms.', '“They can appear as sunspots, melasma, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, which can result from acne, bug bites, and other skin rashes,” says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Marisa Garshick.The different types of dark spots—and why they occurSunspots or Solar Lentigines: According to Dr. Nosworthy, sunspots are typically developed as a result of prolonged UV exposure. “They are commonly found on areas of the skin that are frequently exposed to the sun, such as the face, hands, shoulders, and arms,” she adds.Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH): This type of discoloration is a result of trauma or inflammation of the skin—and why derms caution us from popping our own pimples. However, PIH can also appear after an eczema or psoriasis flare-up.', 'You will notice that once the skin has healed, any injured area may appear darker than the surrounding skin.Melasma: “Melasma causes symmetrical, blotchy, brownish facial pigmentation, often appearing on the forehead, cheeks, and upper lip,” Dr. Nosworthy shares. “It is thought to be related to hormonal changes and sun exposure, and it is more common in women, particularly during pregnancy or when using hormonal contraceptives.”Age Spots or Liver Spots: Much like sunspots, age or liver spots are flat brown or black spots that appear as a result of long-term sun exposure.Which skin types are most prone to developing dark spots?Anyone can develop dark spots. However, the type and their triggers may vary, explains Garshick. “Those with fair skin may be more susceptible to sun spots resulting from cumulative UV exposure that leads to dark spots,” she shares.', '“Those with darker skin may be more likely to experience post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation that appears as a dark spot as a result of increased melanin production.”Nosworthy adds those with hormonally-sensitive skin—for example, those who are pregnant or taking hormonal contraceptives—as well as people who are prone to eczema or psoriasis are also more prone to developing dark spots like melasma or PIH as a result of hormonal fluctuations, skin trauma, or inflammation.Is it possible to get rid of dark spots entirely?Yes—which is great news for anyone with uneven skin tone due to dark spots. However, in order to treat them effectively, it’s important to develop a skin care routine that not only actively targets whichever form of discoloration you have, but also works to prevent it.', '“The most important thing is to remember sun protection,” says Garshick.For at-home treatment, Garshick recommends speaking with a dermatologist first to diagnose which type of dark spots you have—then a skin care regimen can be developed. In general, she’s a fan of retinoids for hyperpigmentation, as they not only help to prevent acne in the first place, but also even out skin tone by stimulating cell turnover. “Other ingredients that may be helpful include azelaic acid, kojic acid, topical tranexamic acid, as well as chemical exfoliants and peels such as glycolic acid or lactic acid,” she adds.Dark spots caused by melasma and sun or liver spots may be more difficult to treat at home.', 'In this case, Nosworthy recommends seeing a dermatologist for an in-office treatment like NeoGen PSR, which Nosworthy describes as “a medical grade energy-based device that uses nitrogen plasma to regenerate the skin’s architecture.” “It is great at treating sun spots, age spots, hyperpigmentation, melasma, scarring—including acne scarring—and more. Most importantly, it can be used on all skin types—light and dark.”If you choose to do an in-office procedure, just be sure to go over at-home aftercare protocols with your doctor once you’ve wrapped up each treatment. “Post-procedure care is especially important to minimize any potential for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation,” says Garshick.', '“It can help to use a product like RescueMD DNA Repair Complex to enhance recovery and minimize irritation, it also works great to reduce inflammation.”How to get rid of dark spots on darker skin tones?When it comes to getting rid of dark spots on darker skin tones, there are plenty of options, including retinoids, hydroquinone, laser treatments, and chemical peels. However, board-certified dermatologist Anetta Reszko says that caution must be used to avoid hyperpigmentation and scarring.What treatments help get rid of dark spots?There are various treatments to choose from, ranging from in-office procedures like lasers and peels to at-home products featuring chemical exfoliants. Specifically for at home use, Reszko suggests people use a selection of hydroquinone, retinoids, vitamin C, and kojic acid. “These active ingredients work by inhibiting melanin production and promoting skin cell turnover.” Sun protection is also key in preventing the production or worsening of dark spots.', '“Look for a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher and apply it daily, even on cloudy days,” she warns.Hydroquinone: As a widely recognized topical agent for hyperpigmentation, hydroquinone works by inhibiting melanin production, effectively lightening dark spots and improving overall skin tone, explains Reszko. While it can be highly effective, it’s important to use it under dermatological supervision to minimize potential side effects like irritation or rebound pigmentation.Retinoids: “Renowned for their ability to accelerate cell turnover and stimulate collagen production, retinoids not only diminish dark spots but also address fine lines and wrinkles, making them a cornerstone in anti-aging skincare,” says Dr. Reszko.', 'She suggests starting with lower concentrations to mitigate potential irritation and always pairing their use with broad-spectrum sunscreen due to increased skin sensitivity.Chemical Peels: “Chemical peels offer a customizable approach to dark spot reduction by exfoliating the skin’s surface and promoting cell regeneration,” says Reszko. There’s a wide range of peels on the market, from superficial to deep peels. Each tailored treatment can effectively diminish pigmentation irregularities, revealing a more radiant complexion. Some of her favorites include Trichloroacetic Acid Peel, otherwise known as a TCA Peel (stronger and penetrates deeper into the skin and typically requires a longer recovery period), as well as Environ’s Cool Peel Technology (which features a low concentration of acid and low pH cool peeling system). This peeling process ultimately helps refine, retexture, and rejuvenate the skin.', 'Reszko suggests a series of mild peels rather than one intense peel, as they do not compromise the integrity of the epidermis, revealing the best skin. She also suggests going for a superficial peel such as salicylic, glycolic, or mandelic acid one, which is typically the better and safer option for people with darker skin. Make sure to apply plenty of sunscreen and moisturize the skin post-peel to optimize results.Laser Treatments: Reszko suggests opting for laser therapies such as Aerolase and Laser Genesis, which offer notable results with minimal downtime—both procedures are under 30 minutes and generally safe for most skin types. “By delivering specific wavelengths of light energy, these treatments effectively break down excess melanin while stimulating collagen production, yielding smoother, more even-toned skin,” she says.', 'However, before you start these treatments, make sure you consult with an expert to ensure this is the best treatment plan for your skin concerns.Chemical Exfoliants: “Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) serve as potent chemical exfoliants, aiding in the removal of dead skin cells and promoting cellular turnover,” explains Dr. Reszko. She continues, “Incorporating these ingredients into skin-care routines can gradually fade dark spots while improving overall skin texture and clarity.” These can be strong, so make sure to start with lower concentrations and gradually increase frequency to minimize potential irritation (baby steps!), and make sure to pack on plenty of sunscreen.Meet the ExpertsDr. Glenicia Nosworthy is an internal medicine physician, specializing in aesthetic medicine.

When I spoke to dermatologists for their recommendations, they said to look for formulations with retinol; vitamin C; kojic, azelaic, or tranexamic acid; and licorice-root extract. “Many of these ingredients inhibit tyrosinase, a key enzyme in the production of melanin,” Dr. Marisa Garshick of MDCS Dermatology explains. The lightening ingredient hydroquinone was also brought up, but Garshick and Dr. Jennifer Gordon at Westlake Dermatology both cautioned that it should be prescribed by a dermatologist to minimize any risk of ochronosis.\\nBelow is a list of the best dark-spot correctors according to the five dermatologists I spoke to.

As a beauty writer who’s struggled with breakouts and blemishes for nearly a decade, I’ve tested brightening moisturizers, retinol serums, acne creams—you name it. One of my favorite products is SkinCeutical Discoloration Defense because it effectively fades away dark spots. After consistently using it, my skin looked clearer and brighter.', 'Ahead, a list of derm-approved spot correctors for your face, hands, back, or arms that actually work.The best dark spot correctors, at a glanceBest Overall: Skinceuticals Discoloration Defense, $108Best Moisturizer for Dark Spots: The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%, $12Best Serum for Dark Spots: Biossance Squalane + Vitamin C Dark Spot Serum, $60Best for Oily, Acne-Prone Skin: CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum, $19Best for Mature Skin: L’Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Day Moisturizer SPF 30, $14Best for Melanated Skin Tones: La Roche-Posay MelaB3 Serum, $45Your dark spot corrector questions, answeredWhat are dark spots?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronA dark spot is an area of extra pigment in the skin, Carmen Castilla, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in NYC, tells Glamour. They can come in a variety of forms, including age spots, sun spots, and melasma.', 'And though they often fade in time, skin-care products like dark spot correctors can speed up the process, evening out your skin tone. Ingredients like hydroquinone, turmeric, and other proven brighteners accelerate skin resurfacing and minimize pigment, says Rachel Nazarian, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology Group in New York City.What ingredients should you look for in a dark spot corrector?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronDark spot correctors help break down hyperpigmentation and can prevent the formation of dark spots by inhibiting the transfer of melanin to skin cells, says Dendy Engelman, MD, a board-certified NYC-based dermatologist in NYC. But it all comes down to the ingredients that help you get there.Dermatologists say to look for alpha hydroxy acids or AHAs (such as lactic acid, glycolic acid, malic acid), retinol, vitamin C, and niacinamide. Dr.', 'Engelman also recommends kojic acid, which is derived from fermented rice, for newer dark spots and acne scars.According to board-certified dermatologist Hope Mitchell, MD, tranexamic acid, cysteamine, azelaic acid, soy, and arbutin are also options that work well to lighten dark spots. “These ingredients will inhibit melanin production and accelerate skin cell turnover, which helps fade pigmentation over time,” she notes. There is another ingredient, called hydroquinone, which can also be effective for lightening dark spots, but derms recommend proceeding with caution. “This ingredient is not safe for those with deeper skin tones, and in some cases, it can actually exacerbate hyperpigmentation in individuals with darker skin,” says Dr.', 'Engelman.How to incorporate dark spot correctors into your routineAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThe dermatologists we spoke with recommend using dark spot correctors like vitamin C, AHAs, azelaic acid, ferulic acid, and alpha arbutin in the morning and dark spot correctors like retinol in the evening, as it can make skin extra sensitive in the sun. And remember: You should avoid using products like retinol and vitamin C serum simultaneously; doing so is likely to cause irritation, says Dr. Castilla. Additionally, consistency is key, and sunscreen will make a world of a difference, according to Dr. Mitchell.Does retinol help dark spots?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevron“Retinol, also known as vitamin A, can help fade hyperpigmentation marks by stimulating cell turnover, so regular use can help fade dark spots over time and has many benefits for the appearance, health, and function of skin overall,” says Dr. Engelman.', 'It’s important to note that retinol can be slightly irritating and drying to certain skin types, so it’s key to build up your tolerance while using it (start with applying it once a week, then twice a week, every other day, and so on).How to treat dark spots on the faceAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThere are many different ways to remove dark spots on the face: laser treatments, microdermabrasion, chemical peels, and dark spot correctors. The latter is most accessible both from a convenience and a cost perspective, since you can use them daily in the comfort of your own home.How to treat dark spots on the bodyAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronIf you’re looking to correct dark spots on the body, look for retinol-based body lotions and creams. Peep the ingredient list for vitamin C for brightening and niacinamide for anti-inflammatory and anti-aging benefits. “And make sure to exfoliate regularly to remove dead skin cells,” says Dr. Mitchell.', 'As always, sunscreen is critical for both the face and body to prevent further darkening.How we tested dark spot correctorsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWe tested dark spot correctors over a series of weeks to months, and some editors (including myself) have been using these products for close to a year or two. We looked for consistency, smell, how quickly they absorbed into the skin and how our skin felt after application.', 'We also paid close attention to how our skin looked after one to two to three weeks of the serums, if we noticed a difference (whether minimal or drastic), and if we think we’ll continue using it in the future.Meet the expertsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronCarmen Castilla, MD, board-certified NYC-based dermatologistRachel Nazarian, MD, board-certified dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology GroupDendy Engelman, MD, board-certified NYC-based dermatologistHope Mitchell, MD, board-certified dermatologist and founder of Mitchell DermatologyBest Overall: Skinceuticals Discoloration DefenseCourtesy of brandSkinceuticals Discoloration Defense$108 Dermstore$108 SkinceuticalsOriginal video by Glamour commerce writer Alanna Martine KilkearyGlamour staffers have tested dozens of Skinceutical products and overwhelmingly give the brand’s products rave reviews.', 'Derms agree that if you’re targeting dark spots from the sun, acne, or medical procedures, you can’t go wrong with this one.Typically, Dr. Castilla recommends a combination approach to treating hyperpigmentation—that’s why she loves the trio of synergistic brightening ingredients present in Skinceuticals’ Discoloration Defence formula: tranexamic acid, kojic acid, and niacinamide. This powerhouse product comes at a higher price tag than other dark spot correctors, but clinical studies have shown that it can be effective at reducing discoloration. Dr. Castilla also notes that this formula is safe to use during pregnancy.Glamour commerce writer Alanna Martine Kilkeary has been a huge fan of this discoloration serum for about three years now. “This serum is extremely lightweight, melts into the skin, and absorbs quickly, which makes it easy to incorporate into my morning skin-care routine.', 'After using it on and off for a couple of years, I always find myself going back to it when I have a stubborn spot left over from a pimple, and it takes about three weeks for it to fully fade away. This serum is consistent and reliable for that reason, and will always be my go-to solution. The only thing I don’t love about this pick is that it’s a little sticky and oxidizes quickly, so I recommend using it all at once.

Look no further than L’Oréal Paris Revitalift. This brightening product also contains vitamin C, retinol, and glycolic acid—all at a drugstore price. “I generally say not to use retinol and glycolic on the same day, but this formulation is gentle while still being effective,” says Dr. Castilla.“I love the silky, smooth texture of this moisturizer,” says Glamour contributor Brigitt Earley. “It spreads readily and evenly—two pumps was the perfect amount for my face and neck.\", 'I have a few small dark spots on my cheek, and while I haven’t yet seen significant improvement there, I do appreciate the instant brightening effect the product gives my skin.

These formerly congested spots were often red and darker, harboring the ghost of my acne’s past, but this little serum slowly but surely brightened these areas with ease. I also noticed an improvement in my skin texture after using this for some time: It’s a lot smoother and less bumpy than it used to be. The consistency of this one is great as well because it absorbs super quickly, doesn’t leave behind any sticky residue, and most importantly, it’s fragrance-free and gentle.', 'If I had to shout from the rooftops about a holy grail skin-care product I couldn’t go on without, it’s probably this one.”Key ingredient(s): Squalane, vitamin C, white shiitakeSkin types: All skin typesSize: 1.01 oz.Pros: Lightweight; vegan and cruelty free; gentleCons: PriceyOriginal photo by Glamour commerce writer Alanna Martine KilkearyOriginal photo by Glamour commerce writer Alanna Martine KilkearyBest with Vitamin C: Glow Recipe Guava Vitamin C Face Serum Dark Spot CorrectorCourtesy of brandGlow Recipe Guava Vitamin C Face Serum Dark Spot Correcto$45 AmazonOriginal video by Glamour commerce writer Alanna Martine Kilkeary“Vitamin C is key for preventing skin damage and dark spot formation in the first place,” says Dr. Engelman, who recommends incorporating one into your morning skin-care routine.

I’ve started using this serum during post-shower gua sha because it helps the tool glide over my skin without being as greasy as a face oil, which can upset my acne-prone skin. By the end of the two-minute routine, the serum is completely rubbed in and I’m ready for sunscreen. I need to test the serum for a little longer to make a definitive call on its brightening properties; I’m also using a prescribed cream to clear up some dermatitis around my eyes.

It was started by three French former researchers from Google and Meta: CEO Arthur Mensch, Chief Scientist Guillaume Lample and Chief Technology Officer Timothee Lacroix.\\nIt has advertised an “open-source” approach to developing AI that involves publicly releasing key components of some AI systems, in contrast to companies such as OpenAI that closely guard them.\\nSomething went wrong while submitting the form.PricingLog inSign upCase studies\\nHow Mistral AI, an OpenAI competitor, rocketed to $2Bn in <12 monthsHow Mistral AI, an OpenAI competitor, rocketed to $2Bn in <12 monthsSaveSavedToday Iâ\\x80\\x99m diving deep into Mistral AI, who are making headlines after recently closing their (huge) Series A round. Launched just 7 months ago, theyâ\\x80\\x99re disrupting the LLM market. I want to look at how theyâ\\x80\\x99re doing it - and how you can take advantage.This post covers:What is Mistral?Whoâ\\x80\\x99s behind it?The timeline: Whatâ\\x80\\x99s happened to dateFundraisingProduct OverviewA peek inside their seed deck ð\\x9f\\x91\\x80 Roadmap analysis. Are they achieving what they set out to do?5 big reasons Mistralâ\\x80\\x99s making waves ð\\x9f\\x8c\\x8aHow people actually use MistralOpportunities and how you can take advantageWhat developers think of MistralWhat is Mistral?A French startup that develops fast, open-source and secure language models.\\nAs Mistral has been true to the promise of releasing open models, the community (and other companies) have taken Mistralâ\\x80\\x99s models and created better models on top of them. For example, OpenHermes 2.5 by Teknium and Neural Chat 7B by Intel.With AI models, open source takes many forms: from available to use locally but no details about the model (weights, architecture etc.) to models that are fully open source and allow users to train on the outputs.While Mistralâ\\x80\\x99s models were open-weights from the start, Mistralâ\\x80\\x99s latest announcement had a line in their Terms of Service Terms of Service which was spotted by Far El on Twitter, said:Basically, you canâ\\x80\\x99t use it to train or improve other models or compete against themâ\\x80¦It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t clear whether this was just for the API platform or the model itself. And unfortunately, open-source means you should be able to use this tech how you like, thatâ\\x80\\x99s kind of the point.\\nFounded in 2023 by Arthur Mensch, Guillaume Lample, and TimothÃ©e Lacroix.Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve raised over $650M in funding, are valued at $2Bn, are less than a year old and have 22 employees.monthly search volume for â\\x80\\x98mistral aiâ\\x80\\x99The company is important for a few reasons;Itâ\\x80\\x99s actually open-source, you know like OpenAI was supposed to be? Or how LlaMA by Meta kinda is but isnâ\\x80\\x99t?Itâ\\x80\\x99s developed 2 AI models in less than a year.Itâ\\x80\\x99s French.The founders are 3 researchers from DeepMind and Meta who aimed to beat GPT 3.5 by year-end.\\nThe big debate.Mistral believes (as do many others, myself included) that there are several concerns with closed AI approaches; businesses have to send sensitive data to it, only exposing the outputs doesnâ\\x80\\x99t help connect with other components (retrieval, structure inputs etc) and the data used to train the models are secret (so we assume it can do some things it perhaps hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been trained on).Now the bold stuff.â\\x80\\x9cMistral will offer the best technology in 4 yearsâ\\x80\\x9d.How?Theyâ\\x80\\x99ll take a more open approach to model development.Tighter integration with customersâ\\x80\\x99 workflows.Increase focus on data sources and control.Propose unmatched guarantees on security and privacy.Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a lot more detail in their deck on the above 4 points.As far as business focus goesâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9cOn the business side, we will provide the most valuable technology brick to the emerging AI-as-a-service industry that will revolutionise business workflows with generative AI.'"
