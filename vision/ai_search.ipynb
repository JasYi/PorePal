Nearly an hour later, the iPhone maker announced a much-rumored partnership with OpenAI to bring its ChatGPT technology to devices later this year.\\nBut Altman, who has emerged as the poster child for generative AI in the 18 months since the launch of ChatGPT, was not featured in Apple’s formal presentation, neither in person or via livestream.', 'Nor did he join Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives in a private press event about privacy and security and the partnership between the two companies.\\n“I was not surprised Sam Altman did not appear on stage,” said Ben Wood, an analyst at market research firm CCS Insight in an interview with CNN. “Apple had to manage the message carefully. OpenAI is merely the vehicle to address broader AI-powered inquiries that are not core to the Apple experience.', 'Having him in the livestream would have only created an unnecessary level of confusion.”\\nEarlier this week, Apple showed off a handful of AI-powered features coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac in the fall – the majority of which are fueled by the company’s own proprietary technology, called Apple Intelligence.\\nThe company will offer OpenAI’s viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity, usually only when Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry.\\nThe move to invite Altman to the announcement but not have him appear before the public also represents in some ways how Apple is cautiously moving forward with the partnership. OpenAI, along with other AI companies, continues to face concerns from researchers, industry experts and government officials around misinformation, biases, copyright, privacy and security, and more.', \"The deal also comes at a time when the industry is moving quickly, and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to engage with the technology responsibly.\\nApple hopes that a big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales as the device has languished without a major upgrade for years and users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices as a result. An uncertain economic environment is also weighing on consumers, particularly in China.\\nApple's newest flagship store has opened in Shanghai.\\nCostfoto/NurPhoto/Getty Images\\nRelated article\\nTim Cook is on a charm offensive in China to revive flagging iPhone sales\\nThe company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington and was recently passed by chip maker Nvidia as the second-largest public company in the US.\", 'In the 60 hours after Apple’s Monday event, however, the company’s stock price (AAPL) rose by as much as 10%, boosting Apple’s market capitalization by more than $300 billion, rocketing past Nvidia and putting Apple back in contention with Microsoft for largest market value.\\nThe timing is further noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies — it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products — but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company’s need to have a smartphone with the latest buzzy technology.\\n“Apple needed to deliver an AI story and Apple Intelligence should help placate nervous investors and reassure them that Apple is keeping pace with its rivals,” Wood added.', '“The partnership with ChatGPT is a major development which beefs up Apple’s AI offerings, and new features like a significantly improved Siri will be welcome to users.”\\nBut the partnership could also open Apple up to some vulnerability, as it has no control over OpenAI’s models or what it does with user inputs. Apple alignment with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust could also cause some challenges down the road.\\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman, center, attends an Apple event in Cupertino, Calif., Monday, June 10, 2024.\\nJeff Chiu/AP\\nA limited partnership\\nAlthough Apple has been working on its own AI program for years, a partnership with OpenAI marks a way for it to fill in the competitive gaps.\\nWhen a user has a question beyond Siri’s scope, ChatGPT can step in. In the demo following the keynote, Apple showed CNN how someone could upload a picture of vegetables at a farmer’s market and ask what they could make for dinner.', 'Siri may suggest that the question is better suited for ChatGPT, and provide the user with a prompt to give consent to use the service.\\nApple using ChatGPT as a complimentary service could potentially cut down on risks associated with the company. It’s also very possible Apple could partner with other AI companies in the future too, such as Google’s Gemini or more niche providers with certain expertise, such as in healthcare.\\n“I think Apple will take a pragmatic approach to the OpenAI partnership,” Wood said.', '“If Apple finds that the relationship with OpenAI starts to affect the overall user experience or worse, create challenges around security and data integrity, it might look to add further guardrails, or find other ways to deliver AI-powered content.”\\nA focus on privacy and security\\nApple has been vocal about how it intends to keep user data private and secure when using its own proprietary technology, noting most AI functions will be done on the phone and inputs will be kept away from a far-off server cloud.\\n“As we look to build in these incredible new capabilities, we want to ensure that the outcome reflects the principles at the core of our products, it has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,” Cook said during the keynote. “It has to be intuitive and easy to use.', 'It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences.”\\n“And, of course, it has to be built with privacy, from the ground up,” he added.\\nApple said it will not share any personal user information with OpenAI, so inquiries made through ChatGPT won’t be linked to an Apple user’s account. And the repeated consent prompt to require users to opt into using ChatGPT with Siri is noteworthy too; each time Siri wants to kick over a question to ChatGPT, it’ll ask for permission first.\\nWood believes the consent prompts and other guardrails that Apple is implementing “reflect its nervousness.”\\nMeanwhile, Reece Hayden, a principal analyst at ABI Research, told CNN that Apple’s approach is smart because it provides customers with a choice of how to deal with their data.\\n“By providing a phased approach that blends ChatGPT and native capabilities, users will worry less about the partnership,” he said.', '“Apple can also continue to highlight their own AI capabilities and mitigate some of the risks of being associated with OpenAI, which remains in a state of flux.”\\nIndustry concerns\\nCompanies like OpenAI have acknowledged the serious risks posed by AI — from manipulation to a loss of control that could potentially result in human extinction — but many experts, researchers and AI employees believe they should be doing more to educate the public about risks and protective measures.', \"Just last week, a group of OpenAI insiders demanded that artificial intelligence companies be far more transparent about the concerns over the technology they’re building.\\nSo it came as no surprise when some industry watchers, including Elon Musk, were quick to react to Apple’s partnership with OpenAI.\\nIn this photo illustration, a woman looks at a laptop screen displaying the logo of 'OpenAI' in Ankara, Turkiye on March 11, 2024.\\nDidem Mente/Anadolu/Getty Images\\nRelated article\\nOpenAI insiders’ open letter warns of ‘serious risks’ and calls for whistleblower protections\\nIn a post to X Monday, Musk said he would ban Apple devices at his companies — which include Tesla, SpaceX and X, among others — if the iPhone maker went ahead with its AI plans.\", 'If Apple “integrates OpenAI at the (operating system) level,” Musk said that would constitute “an unacceptable security violation.”\\nAlthough concerns over how employees are using AI models is a topic of worldwide discussion at the moment across many industries, Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann said Musk’s reaction is a bit misdirected and the topic is not specific to iPhones.\\n“Any employee with a smartphone should follow company policies and not enter

Cook is just a guy with a title. He follows rules and doesn't get fired, but otherwise does everything he can with all the resources at his disposal to make as much money as possible. Given those same constraints and resources, most people with an IQ above 120 would do as well. Apple is an institution unto itself, and you'd have to repeatedly, rapidly, and diabolically corrupt many, many layers of corporate protections to hurt the company intentionally.\", \"Instead, what we see is simple complacency and bureaucracy chipping away at any innovative edge that Apple might once have had.Maintenance and steady piloting is a far different skillset than innovation and creation.Make no mistake, Cook won the lottery. He knew the right people, worked the right jobs, never screwed up anything big, and was at the right place at the right time to land where he is. Good for him, but let's not pretend he got where he is through preternatural skill or competence.I know it's a silicon valley trope and all, but the c-class mythos is so patently absurd. Most of the best leaders just do their best to not screw up.

Same if you swapped Nadella in for Pichai, or Pichai for Cook. Very few of these men are exceptional; they are ordinary men with exceptional resources at hand. What they can do, what they should do, and what they can get away with, unseen, govern their impact.', \"Leaders that actually impact their institutions are incredibly rare. Our current crop of ship steadying industry captains, with few exceptions, are not towering figures of incredible prowess and paragons of leadership. They're regular guys in extraordinary circumstances. Joe Schmo with an MBA, 120 IQ, and the same level of institutional knowledge and 2 decades of experience at Apple could have done the same as Cook; Apple wouldn't have looked much different than it does now.There's a tendency to exaggerate the qualities of men in positions like this. There's nothing inherent to their positions requiring greatness or incredible merit. The extraordinary events already happened; their job is to simply not screw it up, and our system is such that you'd have to try really, really hard to have any noticeable impact, let alone actually hurt a company before the institution itself cuts you out.\", \"Those lawyers are a significant part of the organism of a modern mega corporation; they're the substrate upon which the algorithm that is a corporation is running. One of the defenses modern corporations employ is to limit the impact any individual in the organization can have, positive or otherwise, and to employ intense scrutiny and certainty\\nof action commensurate with the power of a position.Throw Cook into an start-up arena against Musk, Gates, Altman, Jobs, Buffet, etc, and he'd get eaten alive. Cook isn't the scrappy, agile, innovative, ruthless start-up CEO.\", \"He's the complacent, steady, predictable institutional CEO coasting on the laurels of his betters, shielded from the trials they faced through the sheer inertia of the organization he currently helms.They're different types of leaders for different phases of the megacorp organism, and it's OK that Cook isn't Jobs 2.0 - that level of wildness and unpredictability that makes those types of leaders their fortunes can also result in the downfall of their companies. Musk acts with more freedom; the variance in behavior results in a variance of fortunes. Apple is more stable because of Cook, but it's not because he's particularly special.\", \"Simply steady and sane.\\nphilwelch 7 months ago\\n| root | parent | next [–]\\n> They're different types of leaders for different phases of the megacorp organism, and it's OK that Cook isn't Jobs 2.0 - that level of wildness and unpredictability that makes those types of leaders their fortunes can also result in the downfall of their companies.This is absolutely true. But that doesn’t imply that Tim Cook is so unexceptional that anyone with a 120 IQ could do the same job he does. The fact that Steve Jobs himself trusted Cook as his right hand man and successor when Apple probably has literally thousands of employees with at least a 120 IQ should be a sign of that.Partly because little of this is really a question of intelligence. If you want to talk about it in psychometric terms, based on what I’ve read about the man he also seems to have extraordinarily high trait conscientiousness and extraordinarily low trait neuroticism.\", 'The latter of the two actually seems extremely common among corporate executive types—one gets the sense from their weirdly flat and level affect that they are preternaturally unflappable. (Mitt Romney also comes across this way.) I don’t recall where I read this, but I remember reading Jobs being quoted once that Cook was a better negotiator that he was because unlike Jobs, Cook never lost his cool. This isn’t the sign of an unexceptional person, just a person who is exceptional in a much different way than someone like Steve Jobs. And, contrary to what you claim at the top of your comment, someone like Tim Cook is pretty distinguishable from someone like Steve Ballmer in the sense that Ballmer didn’t actually do a good job running Microsoft.', 'I don’t know if that was related to his more exuberant personality—being a weirdly unflappable corporate terminator isn’t the only path to success—but it is a point against these guys being fungible.\\naym62SAE49CZ684 7 months ago\\n| root | parent | next [–]\\nJobs was growth stocks, Cook is fixed income.\\nEach has their place, and there are good and bad versions of each.\\nr00fus 7 months ago\\n| root | parent | prev | next [–]\\n> I look at it from a perspective of interchangeability - if you swapped Steve Ballmer in for Cook, nothing much would have changed.This is quite ridiculous.\\n\"Developers x3\" Ballmer would have face-planted at Apple.\\nHe only coasted so far at Microsoft because Gates had already won the platform war.\\ncyanydeez 7 months ago\\n| root | parent | prev | next [–]\\nHistorians often debate whether Hitler was some supernatural leader, or a product of a culture looking for a scapegoat.I\\'m on the side of culture.', 'That\\'s what I see with most of the business leaders.\\nwg0 7 months ago\\n| parent | prev | next [–]\\nActually, just in three to five years, lots of \"AI boxes\" and those magical sparkling icons next to input fields summoning AI would be silently removed.LLMs are not accurate, they aren\\'t subject matter experts that\\'ll be maybe within 5% error margin.People will gradually learn and discover anf the cost of keeping a model updated and running won\\'t drastically reduce so we\\'ll most likely see dust settling down.\\nRodgerTheGreat 7 months ago\\n| root | parent | next [–]\\nI truly hope the reckless enthusiasm for LLMs will cool down, but it seems plausible that discretized, compressed versions of today\\'s cutting-edge models will eventually be able to run entirely locally, even on mobile devices; there are no guarantees that they\\'ll get better, but many promising opportunities to get the same unreliable results faster and with less power consumption.', \"Once the models run on-device, there's less of a financial motivation to pull the plug, so we could be stuck with them in one form or another for the long haul.\\nnamaria 7 months ago\\n| root | parent | next [–]\\nI don't believe this scenario to be very likely because a lot of the 'magic' in current LLMs (emphasis on 'large') is derived from the size of the training datasets and amount of compute they can throw at training and inference.\\nvaline 7 months ago\\n| root | parent | next [–]\\nLlama 3 8B captures that 'magic' fairly well and runs on a modest gaming PC.

That requires public researcher verification of server software for iOS to even talk to it. (Allegedly :))The OpenAI partnership is seemingly only if Siri decides it doesn\\'t have the full context needed to answer. (E.g. if you ask something very creative/generative.) At that point, Siri says \"hey, chatGPT might be better at answering this, do you consent to me sending your prompt to them?\" and then you get to choose. Apple\\'s partnership also seems to include the various settings that prevent OpenAI from tracking/training on the prompts sent in.Honestly, that more creative side of genAI is not as interesting in the full context of Apple Intelligence.', 'The real power is coming from the local, personal context, where Siri can deduce context based on your emails, messages, calendar events, maps, photos, etc. to really deeply integrate with apps. (Allegedly!) And that part is not OpenAI.\\natlex2 7 months ago\\n| root | parent | next [–]\\nAgreed. Apple pretty clearly focused on building an action-tuned model.

From watching the Keynote, most of Apple Intelligence is their own stuff, mostly on-device.Siri explicitly asks you if you want to use chatGPT to answer a query. It does so when it thinks chatGPT will have a better answer. It sounds like that will be for very creative/generative types of things like \"please create a 4 course meal with xyz foods,\" at which point Siri asks you if you want to use chatGPT.

We may earn an affiliate commission from links.No matter your best efforts, sometimes developing (and then figuring out how to get rid of) dark spots on your face, otherwise known as hyperpigmentation is inevitable. “Dark spots occur when the skin produces excess melanin, the natural brown pigment that gives our skin color,” says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Michele Green.', '“The exact reason why dark spots appear ranges from acne scars to excessive sun exposure to aging to nutritional deficiencies. However, most dark spots are a result of sun exposure.”At-Home Dark Spot TreatmentsThe Expert-Approved Serum: SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic, $182The Gentle Exfoliant: Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Treatment, $85The Retinol: SkinMedica Age Defense Retinol Complex .25, $64The Daily SPF: EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46, $41The Buzzy Serum: Topicals Faded Serum, $38The Supercharged Peel: Dr.', 'Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Universal Daily Peel, $92The Brightening Serum: Ourself Daily Dark Spot Intercept, $260In this sectionWhat are dark spots?Types of dark spots—and why they occurWhich skin types are most prone to developing dark spots?Is it possible to get rid of dark spots entirely?How to get rid of dark spots on darker skin tones?What treatments help get rid of dark spots?Meet the Experts“When your skin is exposed to the sun, its natural reaction is to produce melanin, which helps to block UV radiation from further damaging our DNA and skin. This is often why, when we go into the sun for prolonged periods, our skin gets tanned,” she says. “It is also the reason why individuals with fair skin easily burn in the sun while those with darker skin complexions are less likely to get sunburned. Sometimes, the sun causes an uneven increase in melanin production.', 'This excess melanin gets clumped up and spills in between skin cells, giving the appearance of dark spots.”In short, dark spots are a result of hyperpigmentation. Green notes that most dark spots, such as sun or age spots are preventable with proper SPF protection and sun avoidance. But, if you notice a new spot that changes in size or color, it’s best to consult a board-certified dermatologist to rule out skin cancer. “Anything out of the ordinary, especially if you have fair skin or a family history of skin cancer, should be checked out. I recommend getting regular skin exams so nothing suspicious goes unnoticed,” Green says.', 'Once you’ve determined that a new freckle is harmless, it’s time to prevent and treat it through your at-home skin-care regimen.Below, dermatologists walk us through how to get rid of dark spots—from everyday sun protection to rejuvenating retinol treatments.Firework contentThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.Always Apply SPF“Your first line of defense is always going to be sunscreen. Everyone should wear at least SPF 30 on their face daily and reapply every two hours if outside in the sun, or sitting next to a window,” notes Dr. Corey L. Hartman, founder of Skin Wellness Dermatology in Birmingham, Alabama.Green suggests the EltaMD UV Clear, dubbing it one of the best sunscreens out there. “This product is a lightweight oil-free face sunscreen that works well with all skin types, including acne-prone and sensitive skin,” she says.', '\"It is recommended by the Skin Cancer Foundation for daily use and also contains sodium hyaluronate and lactic acid which helps keep the skin hydrated and your pores clear.” Or, take your pick between La Roche-Posay’s Toleriane or Supergoop!’s Unseen, which pair sheer nourishment with ample SPF protection. Because our experts emphasize the need to apply sunscreen throughout the day, be sure to stock up on convenient formulas that make reapplication simple.', 'Habit’s mister is a lightweight spray formula that delivers UV protection and won’t mess up your makeup.EltaMDUV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46$41 DERMSTORE$41 AMAZONThis lightweight sunscreen has become a cult favorite, thanks to its broad-spectrum sun protection, along with its nourishing formula rich in lactic acid, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid to keep skin hydrated.\\nLa Roche-PosayToleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer UV$25 $19 AMAZONCeramide-3, niacinamide, glycerin, and La Roche Posay’s signature Thermal Spring Water create a skin-loving broad-spectrum SPF 30.\\nSupergoop!Unseen Sunscreen SPF 40$38 DERMSTORE$38 NORDSTROM$38 SEPHORAKnown for its transparent finish, this sunscreen contains red algae, frankincense, and a meadow foam seed complex to protect against blue light, make skin more resilient, and boost hydration levels.\\nHabitN°41 Mister$30 SEPHORA$30 HABITPerfect for those who wish to spritz on their SPF rather than rub it in, an herbal blend of geranium flower, rosemary leaf, and lavender oils work together to add antioxidant protection, tone skin, and reduce inflammation.\\nConsider Antioxidant-Rich Products“You also want to make sure you are using skin-care products with antioxidants, which are essential to helping reduce free radicals that can lead to hyperpigmentation,” says Hartman.', 'Consider vitamins A, C, and E, as well as ferulic acid, resveratrol, and niacinamide. Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Alexis Stephens is a fan of Eadem’s Milk Marvel for fading post-acne dark marks. “The unique formula also helps to prevent future hyperpigmentation and gently resurface the skin. It is uniquely formulated with the\\xa0key ingredients niacinamide, encapsulated vitamin C, amber algae and enzymes.” Stephens also likes the Isdin Sunisdin sun capsules to “help skin\\xa0fight photoaging and the pro-pigmentation UV rays”—along with boosting overall radiance and elasticity.', 'Otherwise, experts recommend the SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic again and again for its environmental protection, or the cosmetic chemist-formulated BeautyStat Universal C to prevent signs of aging without oxidizing.SkinCeuticalsC E Ferulic$182 SKINCEUTICALSA mix of vitamin C, vitamin E, and ferulic acid come together to protect against free radicals and help treat discoloration.\\nBeautyStatUniversal C Skin Refiner$85 DERMSTORE$85 NORDSTROM$85 ULTAThis formula is the world’s first 20% vitamin C serum that contains a stabilized form of the gold standard ingredient.

Take one pill once a day in the morning with plenty of water.', 'You should start to notice results within two weeks.\\nEADEMMilk Marvel Dark Spot Serum$68 SEPHORAFormulated specifically for skin of color, encapsulated vitamin C, niacinamide, amber algae, as well as papaya and pineapple enzymes help to curb hyperpigmentation fast.\\nReach for Retin-A or Retinol“It’s also important to get into the habit of gently exfoliating the skin\\xa0to remove dead skin cells that are often harboring excess pigment. This can be done by using a topical retinoid product that both treats and fades hyperpigmentation,” explains Stephens. While Green says that retin-a (tretinoin) or retinoids are best, an ingredient that can be picked up by a beauty subscription service like Curology, retinol is the next best bet without a prescription.“Retinol is a weaker over-the-counter formula of retinoids and can provide similar benefits in reducing the appearance of dark spots, although it will typically take much longer,” Green explains.', 'Take your pick of SkinCeuticals’s Retinol 0.3, SkinMedica’s Retinol Complex .25, or CeraVe’s Skin Renewing serum to experience the restorative benefits of the oft-recommended ingredient.CurologyFuture-Proof Rx$60 CUROLOGYThis prescription-strength product is customized just for you—so your skin will be getting exactly what it needs.\\nSkinMedicaAge Defense Retinol Complex .25$64 DERMSTOREThe formula’s retinol is paired with the brand’s trademark PhytoShield Complex to help curb irritation while also enhancing skin texture.\\nSkinCeuticalsRetinol 0.3$78 SKINCEUTICALSIf you’re new to retinoids, this may be the product for you.', 'A concentration of 0.3% retinol is paired with soothing ingredients like bisabolol to prevent any bad side physical effects.\\nCeraVeSkin Renewing Retinol Serum$25 $23 AMAZON$27 ULTAEncapsulated retinol helps to fight discoloration and smooth out fine lines, while ceramides protect the skin barrier.\\nIncorporate Gentle ExfoliantsHartman suggests “a product with an exfoliating active ingredient, like AHA, to help remove the top surface layer of the skin to treat dark spots.” This category of exfoliants includes glycolic, mandelic, and lactic acids which Stephens says “helps to remove dead skin cells while moisturizing the skin.” If you’d prefer a serum formula, Sunday Riley’s Good Genes is a solid option packed with lactic acid to exfoliate and brighten, whereas Alpha-H’s glycolic acid-enriched formula is an excellent liquid exfoliant known to improve skin tone and texture overnight. Similarly, at-home peels might be worth incorporating for those unable to get a professional treatment.', 'Take options by M-61 or Dr. Dennis Gross’s peels, for example; these supercharged towelettes help reduce the look of discoloration through a cocktail of exfoliating acids.Alpha-HLiquid Gold with 5% Glycolic Acid$56 NORDSTROM$56 SEPHORAIt’s not called Liquid Gold for no reason.

Those interested in a dermatologist-approved solution should seriously consider Cyspera’s system that Hartman advocates for. “Cyspera is my first choice for patients dealing with hyperpigmentation, especially patients of color, as hyperpigmentation can be difficult to treat successfully in darker skin,” he details. “Its active ingredient, cysteamine, is an exclusive amino acid derivative that helps reduce pigment and is effective in treating all skin tones.” Or, there’s board-certified dermatologist Dr.', 'Shereene Idriss’s recently-launched brand, PillowtalkDerm, which features a Major Fade collection formulated, in part, based on her own experience treating melasma and discoloration.On the other hand, there are a few contemporary beauty labels making waves for their efficacious offerings. There is Topicals Faded serum which uses a blend of tranexamic acid, azelaic acid, and niacinamide to reduce the look of dark spots, patches, and post-acne scarring. Ourself’s brightening serum, on the other hand, is powered by the brand’s patented technology enriched by the likes of peptides and powerhouse brightening ingredients, alongside vitamin C and niacinamide to intercept the overproduction of new melanin and lighten existing spots. Or perhaps a patch approach works best for your regimen?', 'In that case, Hero Cosmetics recently launched a new and improved version of its Micropoint patches which deposits tranexamic acid, vitamin C, licorice root, and niacinamide onto dark spots through 395 micropoints to fade post-blemish marks.CysperaIntensive System$299 CYSPERAThis three-step system tackles even the most stubborn dark spots.

She reaches for the Bluestone Sunshields for extra protection. For the body, consider Lululemon’s shirt which offers UPF 40+ protection.', '“If possible, try to avoid going out for prolonged periods when the sun is at its strongest between 10 am and 4 pm.,” says Green, who adds that a wide-brimmed hat or sunglasses are a good choice to protect your eyes and scalp from the sun.Bluestone SunshieldsFull Lux Visor$68 NORDSTROMChoose from five metallic colors that will give your face complete physical protection from the sun.\\nLululemonUV Protection Running Long Sleeve Shirt$88 $64 LULULEMONOffering up to UPF 40+ protection, be sure to slip this shirt on before heading out to enjoy a day in the sun.\\nWhat are dark spots?Otherwise known as discoloration or hyperpigmentation, dark spots are any area of the skin that appear darker than the surrounding skin. “This is due to an excess production of melanin—the pigment responsible for skin color,” explains aesthetic physician Dr. Glenicia Nosworthy.Something else to note is that there are different types of dark spots—and they can all show up on the skin in various forms.', '“They can appear as sunspots, melasma, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, which can result from acne, bug bites, and other skin rashes,” says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Marisa Garshick.The different types of dark spots—and why they occurSunspots or Solar Lentigines: According to Dr. Nosworthy, sunspots are typically developed as a result of prolonged UV exposure. “They are commonly found on areas of the skin that are frequently exposed to the sun, such as the face, hands, shoulders, and arms,” she adds.Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH): This type of discoloration is a result of trauma or inflammation of the skin—and why derms caution us from popping our own pimples. However, PIH can also appear after an eczema or psoriasis flare-up.', 'You will notice that once the skin has healed, any injured area may appear darker than the surrounding skin.Melasma: “Melasma causes symmetrical, blotchy, brownish facial pigmentation, often appearing on the forehead, cheeks, and upper lip,” Dr. Nosworthy shares. “It is thought to be related to hormonal changes and sun exposure, and it is more common in women, particularly during pregnancy or when using hormonal contraceptives.”Age Spots or Liver Spots: Much like sunspots, age or liver spots are flat brown or black spots that appear as a result of long-term sun exposure.Which skin types are most prone to developing dark spots?Anyone can develop dark spots. However, the type and their triggers may vary, explains Garshick. “Those with fair skin may be more susceptible to sun spots resulting from cumulative UV exposure that leads to dark spots,” she shares.', '“Those with darker skin may be more likely to experience post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation that appears as a dark spot as a result of increased melanin production.”Nosworthy adds those with hormonally-sensitive skin—for example, those who are pregnant or taking hormonal contraceptives—as well as people who are prone to eczema or psoriasis are also more prone to developing dark spots like melasma or PIH as a result of hormonal fluctuations, skin trauma, or inflammation.Is it possible to get rid of dark spots entirely?Yes—which is great news for anyone with uneven skin tone due to dark spots. However, in order to treat them effectively, it’s important to develop a skin care routine that not only actively targets whichever form of discoloration you have, but also works to prevent it.', '“The most important thing is to remember sun protection,” says Garshick.For at-home treatment, Garshick recommends speaking with a dermatologist first to diagnose which type of dark spots you have—then a skin care regimen can be developed. In general, she’s a fan of retinoids for hyperpigmentation, as they not only help to prevent acne in the first place, but also even out skin tone by stimulating cell turnover. “Other ingredients that may be helpful include azelaic acid, kojic acid, topical tranexamic acid, as well as chemical exfoliants and peels such as glycolic acid or lactic acid,” she adds.Dark spots caused by melasma and sun or liver spots may be more difficult to treat at home.', 'In this case, Nosworthy recommends seeing a dermatologist for an in-office treatment like NeoGen PSR, which Nosworthy describes as “a medical grade energy-based device that uses nitrogen plasma to regenerate the skin’s architecture.” “It is great at treating sun spots, age spots, hyperpigmentation, melasma, scarring—including acne scarring—and more. Most importantly, it can be used on all skin types—light and dark.”If you choose to do an in-office procedure, just be sure to go over at-home aftercare protocols with your doctor once you’ve wrapped up each treatment. “Post-procedure care is especially important to minimize any potential for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation,” says Garshick.', '“It can help to use a product like RescueMD DNA Repair Complex to enhance recovery and minimize irritation, it also works great to reduce inflammation.”How to get rid of dark spots on darker skin tones?When it comes to getting rid of dark spots on darker skin tones, there are plenty of options, including retinoids, hydroquinone, laser treatments, and chemical peels. However, board-certified dermatologist Anetta Reszko says that caution must be used to avoid hyperpigmentation and scarring.What treatments help get rid of dark spots?There are various treatments to choose from, ranging from in-office procedures like lasers and peels to at-home products featuring chemical exfoliants. Specifically for at home use, Reszko suggests people use a selection of hydroquinone, retinoids, vitamin C, and kojic acid. “These active ingredients work by inhibiting melanin production and promoting skin cell turnover.” Sun protection is also key in preventing the production or worsening of dark spots.', '“Look for a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher and apply it daily, even on cloudy days,” she warns.Hydroquinone: As a widely recognized topical agent for hyperpigmentation, hydroquinone works by inhibiting melanin production, effectively lightening dark spots and improving overall skin tone, explains Reszko. While it can be highly effective, it’s important to use it under dermatological supervision to minimize potential side effects like irritation or rebound pigmentation.Retinoids: “Renowned for their ability to accelerate cell turnover and stimulate collagen production, retinoids not only diminish dark spots but also address fine lines and wrinkles, making them a cornerstone in anti-aging skincare,” says Dr. Reszko.', 'She suggests starting with lower concentrations to mitigate potential irritation and always pairing their use with broad-spectrum sunscreen due to increased skin sensitivity.Chemical Peels: “Chemical peels offer a customizable approach to dark spot reduction by exfoliating the skin’s surface and promoting cell regeneration,” says Reszko. There’s a wide range of peels on the market, from superficial to deep peels. Each tailored treatment can effectively diminish pigmentation irregularities, revealing a more radiant complexion. Some of her favorites include Trichloroacetic Acid Peel, otherwise known as a TCA Peel (stronger and penetrates deeper into the skin and typically requires a longer recovery period), as well as Environ’s Cool Peel Technology (which features a low concentration of acid and low pH cool peeling system). This peeling process ultimately helps refine, retexture, and rejuvenate the skin.', 'Reszko suggests a series of mild peels rather than one intense peel, as they do not compromise the integrity of the epidermis, revealing the best skin. She also suggests going for a superficial peel such as salicylic, glycolic, or mandelic acid one, which is typically the better and safer option for people with darker skin. Make sure to apply plenty of sunscreen and moisturize the skin post-peel to optimize results.Laser Treatments: Reszko suggests opting for laser therapies such as Aerolase and Laser Genesis, which offer notable results with minimal downtime—both procedures are under 30 minutes and generally safe for most skin types. “By delivering specific wavelengths of light energy, these treatments effectively break down excess melanin while stimulating collagen production, yielding smoother, more even-toned skin,” she says.', 'However, before you start these treatments, make sure you consult with an expert to ensure this is the best treatment plan for your skin concerns.Chemical Exfoliants: “Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) serve as potent chemical exfoliants, aiding in the removal of dead skin cells and promoting cellular turnover,” explains Dr. Reszko. She continues, “Incorporating these ingredients into skin-care routines can gradually fade dark spots while improving overall skin texture and clarity.” These can be strong, so make sure to start with lower concentrations and gradually increase frequency to minimize potential irritation (baby steps!), and make sure to pack on plenty of sunscreen.Meet the ExpertsDr. Glenicia Nosworthy is an internal medicine physician, specializing in aesthetic medicine.

When I spoke to dermatologists for their recommendations, they said to look for formulations with retinol; vitamin C; kojic, azelaic, or tranexamic acid; and licorice-root extract. “Many of these ingredients inhibit tyrosinase, a key enzyme in the production of melanin,” Dr. Marisa Garshick of MDCS Dermatology explains. The lightening ingredient hydroquinone was also brought up, but Garshick and Dr. Jennifer Gordon at Westlake Dermatology both cautioned that it should be prescribed by a dermatologist to minimize any risk of ochronosis.\\nBelow is a list of the best dark-spot correctors according to the five dermatologists I spoke to. One note before getting into the products: Every expert I spoke to emphasized the importance of wearing sunscreen diligently.', 'It keeps dark spots from coming back after treatment, and more importantly, it protects you from further UV damage.\\nUpdate on October 4, 2024: Replaced the out-of-stock YSE Beauty Vitamin C Serum Morning Cocktail with the Revision C+ Correcting Complex 30 as the best vitamin-C dark-spot corrector; updated prices and checked stock for all other products.\\nBest dark-spot corrector overall\\nSkinCeuticals Discoloration Defense\\n$110\\nSkinCeuticals’ Discoloration Defense is effective, lightweight, and gentle enough for most skin types and everyday use. Two dermatologists I spoke with\\xa0— Dr. Gordon and Dr. Brendan Camp of MDCS Dermatology —\\xa0recommended it, and it’s been brought up in the past when we tackled getting rid of dark spots on the body. Surprisingly, it’s not made with retinol or vitamin C, the two ingredients found in the rest of the products listed.', 'Instead, it’s formulated with a cocktail of tranexamic acid, kojic acid, niacinamide, and sulfonic acid, which work together to exfoliate, improve brightness, and reduce the chances of dark spots reappearing.\\n$110\\nat Dermstore\\nBuy\\n$110\\nat SkinCeuticals\\nBuy\\nBest less expensive dark-spot corrector\\nLa Roche Posay MelaB3 Serum\\n$45\\n$45\\nIf Skinceuticals is out of your budget, La Roche-Posay’s new Mela B3 serum comes under $50 and is recommended by Dr. Garshick.

As a beauty writer who’s struggled with breakouts and blemishes for nearly a decade, I’ve tested brightening moisturizers, retinol serums, acne creams—you name it. One of my favorite products is SkinCeutical Discoloration Defense because it effectively fades away dark spots.

They can come in a variety of forms, including age spots, sun spots, and melasma.', 'And though they often fade in time, skin-care products like dark spot correctors can speed up the process, evening out your skin tone. Ingredients like hydroquinone, turmeric, and other proven brighteners accelerate skin resurfacing and minimize pigment, says Rachel Nazarian, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology Group in New York City.What ingredients should you look for in a dark spot corrector?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronDark spot correctors help break down hyperpigmentation and can prevent the formation of dark spots by inhibiting the transfer of melanin to skin cells, says Dendy Engelman, MD, a board-certified NYC-based dermatologist in NYC. But it all comes down to the ingredients that help you get there.Dermatologists say to look for alpha hydroxy acids or AHAs (such as lactic acid, glycolic acid, malic acid), retinol, vitamin C, and niacinamide. Dr.', 'Engelman also recommends kojic acid, which is derived from fermented rice, for newer dark spots and acne scars.According to board-certified dermatologist Hope Mitchell, MD, tranexamic acid, cysteamine, azelaic acid, soy, and arbutin are also options that work well to lighten dark spots. “These ingredients will inhibit melanin production and accelerate skin cell turnover, which helps fade pigmentation over time,” she notes. There is another ingredient, called hydroquinone, which can also be effective for lightening dark spots, but derms recommend proceeding with caution. “This ingredient is not safe for those with deeper skin tones, and in some cases, it can actually exacerbate hyperpigmentation in individuals with darker skin,” says Dr.', 'Engelman.How to incorporate dark spot correctors into your routineAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThe dermatologists we spoke with recommend using dark spot correctors like vitamin C, AHAs, azelaic acid, ferulic acid, and alpha arbutin in the morning and dark spot correctors like retinol in the evening, as it can make skin extra sensitive in the sun. And remember: You should avoid using products like retinol and vitamin C serum simultaneously; doing so is likely to cause irritation, says Dr. Castilla. Additionally, consistency is key, and sunscreen will make a world of a difference, according to Dr. Mitchell.Does retinol help dark spots?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevron“Retinol, also known as vitamin A, can help fade hyperpigmentation marks by stimulating cell turnover, so regular use can help fade dark spots over time and has many benefits for the appearance, health, and function of skin overall,” says Dr. Engelman.', 'It’s important to note that retinol can be slightly irritating and drying to certain skin types, so it’s key to build up your tolerance while using it (start with applying it once a week, then twice a week, every other day, and so on).How to treat dark spots on the faceAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronThere are many different ways to remove dark spots on the face: laser treatments, microdermabrasion, chemical peels, and dark spot correctors. The latter is most accessible both from a convenience and a cost perspective, since you can use them daily in the comfort of your own home.How to treat dark spots on the bodyAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronIf you’re looking to correct dark spots on the body, look for retinol-based body lotions and creams. Peep the ingredient list for vitamin C for brightening and niacinamide for anti-inflammatory and anti-aging benefits. “And make sure to exfoliate regularly to remove dead skin cells,” says Dr. Mitchell.', 'As always, sunscreen is critical for both the face and body to prevent further darkening.How we tested dark spot correctorsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWe tested dark spot correctors over a series of weeks to months, and some editors (including myself) have been using these products for close to a year or two. We looked for consistency, smell, how quickly they absorbed into the skin and how our skin felt after application.', 'We also paid close attention to how our skin looked after one to two to three weeks of the serums, if we noticed a difference (whether minimal or drastic), and if we think we’ll continue using it in the future.Meet the expertsAccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronCarmen Castilla, MD, board-certified NYC-based dermatologistRachel Nazarian, MD, board-certified dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology GroupDendy Engelman, MD, board-certified NYC-based dermatologistHope Mitchell, MD, board-certified dermatologist and founder of Mitchell DermatologyBest Overall: Skinceuticals Discoloration DefenseCourtesy of brandSkinceuticals Discoloration Defense$108 Dermstore$108 SkinceuticalsOriginal video by Glamour commerce writer Alanna Martine KilkearyGlamour staffers have tested dozens of Skinceutical products and overwhelmingly give the brand’s products rave reviews.', 'Derms agree that if you’re targeting dark spots from the sun, acne, or medical procedures, you can’t go wrong with this one.Typically, Dr. Castilla recommends a combination approach to treating hyperpigmentation—that’s why she loves the trio of synergistic brightening ingredients present in Skinceuticals’ Discoloration Defence formula: tranexamic acid, kojic acid, and niacinamide. This powerhouse product comes at a higher price tag than other dark spot correctors, but clinical studies have shown that it can be effective at reducing discoloration. Dr. Castilla also notes that this formula is safe to use during pregnancy.Glamour commerce writer Alanna Martine Kilkeary has been a huge fan of this discoloration serum for about three years now. “This serum is extremely lightweight, melts into the skin, and absorbs quickly, which makes it easy to incorporate into my morning skin-care routine.', 'After using it on and off for a couple of years, I always find myself going back to it when I have a stubborn spot left over from a pimple, and it takes about three weeks for it to fully fade away. This serum is consistent and reliable for that reason, and will always be my go-to solution. The only thing I don’t love about this pick is that it’s a little sticky and oxidizes quickly, so I recommend using it all at once. If you want to use it on a case by case basis like me, keep it stored somewhere dark and cool.”Key ingredient(s): Tranexamic acid, kojic acid, niacinamideSkin types: All skin typesSize: 1 fl.', \"oz.Pros: Pregnancy-safeCons: PriceyOriginal image by Glamour commerce writer Alanna Martine KilkearyOriginal image by Glamour commerce writer Alanna Martine KilkearyBest for Mature Skin: L’Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Day Moisturizer SPF 30Courtesy of brandL'Oreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Day Moisturizer SPF 30$20 $15 Amazon$20 WalmartOriginal video by Glamour contributor Brigitt EarlyLooking for moisturizer, SPF, and dark spot treatment all in one? Look no further than L’Oréal Paris Revitalift. This brightening product also contains vitamin C, retinol, and glycolic acid—all at a drugstore price. “I generally say not to use retinol and glycolic on the same day, but this formulation is gentle while still being effective,” says Dr. Castilla.“I love the silky, smooth texture of this moisturizer,” says Glamour contributor Brigitt Earley. “It spreads readily and evenly—two pumps was the perfect amount for my face and neck.\", 'I have a few small dark spots on my cheek, and while I haven’t yet seen significant improvement there, I do appreciate the instant brightening effect the product gives my skin.

I also love the peptides and hyaluronic acid in this pick because after application my skin looks taught and plump.

These formerly congested spots were often red and darker, harboring the ghost of my acne’s past, but this little serum slowly but surely brightened these areas with ease. I also noticed an improvement in my skin texture after using this for some time: It’s a lot smoother and less bumpy than it used to be. The consistency of this one is great as well because it absorbs super quickly, doesn’t leave behind any sticky residue, and most importantly, it’s fragrance-free and gentle.', 'If I had to shout from the rooftops about a holy grail skin-care product I couldn’t go on without, it’s probably this one.”Key ingredient(s): Squalane, vitamin C, white shiitakeSkin types: All skin typesSize: 1.01 oz.Pros: Lightweight; vegan and cruelty free; gentleCons: PriceyOriginal photo by Glamour commerce writer Alanna Martine KilkearyOriginal photo by Glamour commerce writer Alanna Martine KilkearyBest with Vitamin C: Glow Recipe Guava Vitamin C Face Serum Dark Spot CorrectorCourtesy of brandGlow Recipe Guava Vitamin C Face Serum Dark Spot Correcto$45 AmazonOriginal video by Glamour commerce writer Alanna Martine Kilkeary“Vitamin C is key for preventing skin damage and dark spot formation in the first place,” says Dr. Engelman, who recommends incorporating one into your morning skin-care routine.

I’ve started using this serum during post-shower gua sha because it helps the tool glide over my skin without being as greasy as a face oil, which can upset my acne-prone skin. By the end of the two-minute routine, the serum is completely rubbed in and I’m ready for sunscreen. I need to test the serum for a little longer to make a definitive call on its brightening properties; I’m also using a prescribed cream to clear up some dermatitis around my eyes. However, dark marks have seemed to be fading faster than usual over the past few weeks, and the skin around my eyes is clearer and lighter.', '(I don’t want to attribute this all to Nova, but it does seem to be working in tandem with my prescription, and it at least hasn’t made things worse.)

This Mela B3 serum delivered the perfect dose of hydration without clogging up the vibes—or the pores. With the 10% niacinamide, I was bracing for a little irritation, but surprisingly we’re good. I’ve been using it twice a day for a little over a week now, and while my dark spots haven’t budged yet my skin is definitely smoother and even has a bit of a glow.

I made sure to pair it with daily SPF. Although I don’t have sensitive skin, I’m happy to report that I didn’t experience any irritation from daily use.

That being said, board-certified dermatologist Dr. Libby Rhee says hyperpigmentation spots on the face and body that are flat, round, or oval-shaped and have a history of frequent direct sun exposure can likely be treated with a correcting formula.\\nWe researched dozens of dark spot correctors before ultimately testing 13 formulas over 12 weeks to find the best dark spot correctors. We looked at many factors, including how well they faded dark spots, ease of application, and how well they worked with other skincare products.', 'After several weeks of trying them out in real life, these 11 are worth the buy.\\nOur Top Picks\\nBest Overall:\\nHyper Skin Hyper Even Vitamin C Serum at Amazon\\n$66\\nJump to Review\\nBest Overall, But for Less:\\nSALE\\nNeutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Dark Spot Corrector at Amazon\\n$30\\n$22\\nJump to Review\\nBest for Acne-Prone Skin:\\nPCA Skin Pigment Gel HQ Free at Nordstrom\\n$95\\nJump to Review\\nBest for Dark Circles:\\nHero Cosmetics Lightning Wand at Amazon\\n$20\\nJump to Review\\nBest Lightweight:\\nSALE\\nFenty Skin Watch Ya Tone 5% Niacinamide Dark Spot Serum at Amazon\\n$29\\n$23\\nJump to Review\\nBest for Sensitive Skin:\\nSkinCeuticals Discoloration Defense at Dermstore\\n$110\\nJump to Review\\nBest with Blue Light Protection:\\nSALE\\nVeracity Brightening Support at Amazon\\n$55\\n$28\\nJump to Review\\nBest for Body:\\nCityGoo Dark Spot Remover at Amazon\\n$20\\nJump to Review\\nBest for Blemishes:\\nDr.', \"Barbara Sturm Untinted Clarifying Spot Treatment at Sephora\\n$55\\nJump to Review\\nBest Firming:\\nGlow Recipe Vitamin C Dark Spot Serum at Amazon\\n$45\\nJump to Review\\nBest Overall\\nHyper Skin Hyper Even Vitamin C Serum\\n$66 at Amazon\\n$26 at Sephora\\n$58 at Revolve\\nStar Qualities\\nOur dark spots faded significantly after just one month of regular use\\nHydrating hyaluronic acid supports skin health and creates a better environment for regeneration\\nTurmeric and salicylic acid prevent future breakouts\\nRed Flags\\nWe simply loved everything about this dark spot corrector!\\nIf you're looking for a great beauty product, our top pick for the best dark spot corrector overall is the Hyper Skin Brightening Dark Spot Vitamin C Serum.

For a dark spot corrector with both vitamin C and retinol, consider the Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Retinol and Vitamin C Dark Spot Corrector, which is our top pick for anti-aging.\\nSkin Type\\nAs with most skincare products, it’s also important to consider your skin type and its compatibility with a formula. “Opt for products formulated to suit your skin, whether it’s oily, dry, or sensitive, to minimize the risk of irritation,” says Dr. Pearl Grimes, the chief dermatologist at Mother Science.\\nGenerally speaking, most dark spot correctors on our list are formulated with all skin types in mind.', 'However, if you have sensitive skin, it’s important to pay close attention to certain formulas — like the retinol-infused Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Retinol and Vitamin C Dark Spot Corrector — as it may include ingredients that cause irritation.\\nSkincare Routine\\nWhile it’s not exactly something to look for in a dark spot corrector, Dr. Engelman says it’s super important to consider your skincare routine and support the process through SPF and moisturizer. “Keeping the skin properly protected with a broad spectrum SPF helps prevent new dark spots from forming,” she explains. For this reason, Dr. Engelman recommends adding SPF to your routine along with the dark spot corrector.\\nIn addition to sunscreen, facial moisturizer is essential for someone with dark spots. “The more moisturized and pliable your skin is, the better the healing process,” says Dr. Engelman.', '“Adding moisture back into the skin can help reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation and prevent new spots from forming.”\\nPeople / Tamara Staples\\nBehind the Scenes\\nTo find the best dark spot correctors, our PEOPLE Tested team began by researching top formulas before selecting 13 formulas to take out for a spin in the real world for a 12-week testing period.\\nTexture and Absorption: Throughout this time, testers checked in regularly, taking careful and extensive notes on their experiences, including how the formula felt on the skin, and how well it absorbed into the skin.Application: Testers made note of how much product was needed for effective coverage, and how well the dark spot correctors layered with both skincare and makeup formulas.Effectiveness: Throughout the three-month testing period, we also noted the fading process and how well the formulas worked at fading dark spots altogether, as well as considered how the correcting formulas impacted our skin’s texture and glow.\\nOnce testing was completed, we came together and shared our notes and insights to determine which dark spot correctors deserve a spot on our top picks list.', 'We meticulously reviewed the notes for each product, comparing the formulas and experiences before narrowing everything down to the 11 best dark spot correctors.\\nPeople / Tamara Staples\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\nWhat is the fastest way to fade dark spots?\\nThe best and fastest way to fade dark spots is usually through laser treatments such as Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) Therapy. However, if you’re looking to fade dark spots at home through dark spot correctors, Dr. Engelman says to start treatment as soon as possible when the damage is fresh.“This will help prevent and heal the dark spot as cellular turnover, induced by the product, will work to remove the top layers of the skin and replace it with newer, brighter skin,” she explains, adding that addressing dark spots ASAP will help fade them faster.In addition to lasers and using dark spot correctors sooner than later, Dr. Engelman recommends using chemical peels to improve the look of dark spots.', '“These use a powerful dose of acids to weaken the cellular bonds between skin cells in the dermis,” she notes. “The exfoliation helps to slough away dead skin cells and reveal healthy ones, improving hyperpigmentation and skin texture.”\\nWhat causes dark spots?\\n“Dark spots are scars caused by post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or discoloration of the skin due to damage such as acne scars or sun exposure,” Dr. Engelman tells PEOPLE. While many types of dark spots are common and harmless, Dr. Engelman notes that people choose to fade them for cosmetic reasons in pursuit of a more even skin tone.\\nHow do you permanently fade dark spots?\\n“Prescription medications like tretinoin and dark spot correctors can successfully permanently fade dark spots, as can more expensive treatments like laser procedures and chemical peels,” says Rhee.', '“However, it’s also important to proactively prevent dark spots by using a broad-spectrum sunscreen as part of your daily routine, as sun damage is a common reason behind the presence of dark spots.”\\xa0With that said, Dr.', 'Engelman notes that the success of fading dark spots depends on the person, skin type, damage, and treatment.\\nWhat is the number one dark spot corrector?\\nOur top pick for the best dark spot corrector is the Hyper Skin Brightening Dark Spot Vitamin C Serum, which is formulated with a potent mix of vitamin C, kojic acid, and hyaluronic acid and designed to promote a more even-looking complexion all over while also targeting specific blemishes.For a more budget-friendly option, we also love the Versed Out of Sight Dark Spot Gel, which is more of a spot treatment and formulated with tranexamic acid — which can target the most stubborn forms of hyperpigmentation — and kojic acid, licorice root, and niacinamide to fade blemishes.\\nWhy trust PEOPLE?\\nJessie Quinn is a contributing writer for PEOPLE.', 'When covering the best dark spot correctors, Jessie started by thoroughly reviewing the PEOPLE Tested team’s insights, carefully paying attention to the way each formula felt on the skin during the application process, how well they absorbed into the skin, and whether or not the correctors were effective at fading dark spots.

Dark spots can occur on the face as well as body skin such as hands and décolletage as a result of sun exposure, genetics, hormones and inflammation, says Howard Murad, M.D., board-certified dermatologist and founder of Murad Skincare, and often become more prevalent with age. A simple solution? Dark spot corrector skincare products, which are made to help fade unwanted hyperpigmentation. \"Dark spot correctors are used to lighten and diminish skin hyperpigmentation resulting from acne, sun damage or an otherwise uneven skin tone,\" says Alan J.', 'Parks, M.D., dermatologist and founder of DermWarehouse in Columbus, Ohio. \"They usually work by inhibiting the enzyme tyrosinase, which is responsible for the production of melanin in the skin, and may also increase the rate at which skin cells renew themselves, ridding the skin of the dead, damaged cells faster and making way for fresh, new cells.\" GH Beauty Lab Senior Chemist Danusia Wnek\\nrecommends treatments that contain ingredients like retinol, vitamin C, niacinamide and kojic acid.\\nTo find the best dark spot correctors, the Good Housekeeping Institute Beauty, Health and Sustainability Lab scientists evaluate hundreds of skincare products every year, including ones that claim to correct dark spots.

In the Lab, their skin is scanned with the Visia Complexion Analyzer machine to measure changes in the size and count of dark spots, plus pores, skin texture and lines and wrinkles before and after weeks of use, as pictured.Consumer testers also report their feedback on factors like ease of use, cosmetic properties (i.e. texture, scent), application and the look and feel of their skin following the testing period.', 'The clinical and consumer data is then tallied to find the products that really perform.What to look for when shopping for dark spot correctorsWhen shopping for dark spot correcting treatments, which can include serums, moisturizers and exfoliators like peels, seek out mentions of dark spots, hyperpigmentation, \"brightening\" and “skin tone-evening\" on the packaging, GH Beauty Lab experts suggest. Dr. Parks recommends choosing formulas that contain skincare ingredients like:✔️ Vitamin C, an antioxidant that brightens skin and may help reduce the appearance of dark spots, Wizemann says. ✔️ Niacinamide (a form of\\nvitamin B3), which is also \"shown to brighten skin and at a 5% concentration can lighten dark marks,\" Wizemann explains.✔️ Retinol and alpha or beta hydroxy acids (like glycolic, lactic, azelaic and salicylic acids), which increase skin cell turnover to get rid of hyperpigmented cells.', '✔️ Kojic acid, which \"inhibits melanin production and has been studied for its spot-lightening abilities, particularly for conditions like facial melasma,\" Wizemann notes.✔️ Tranexamic acid, alpha-arbutin, cysteamine, resorcinol, soy and licorice root extract, as these can also lessen hyperpigmentation, Dr. Turegano adds.✔️ Hydroquinone, a potent, fast-acting dark spot brightener, Wizemann says. \"It interrupts melanin synthesis to even tone,” explains Sara Hogan, M.D., a dermatologist in McLean, Virginia. (Note that this ingredient is only available by prescription.)Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowWhat causes dark spots?\"The sun is one of the biggest contributors to developing and accentuating dark marks,\" Dr. Turegano says, so applying a broad spectrum SPF 30 or higher sunscreen daily is a must in order to see a reduction in dark spots. Hormones, genetics and inflammation can contribute to hyperpigmentation. Dark spots are also common in deeper skin tones.', '\"In darker complexions, the presence of more and larger melanosomes, organelles produced by skin pigment cells that contain skin color, increases the likelihood that hyperpigmentation, or unwanted darkening, can develop,\" Dr. Hogan explains.Do dark spot correctors really work?\"Dark spot correctors can be effective for some people, depending on the severity and type of dark spot, including sunspots (caused by sun exposure), melasma (hormonal pigmentation often occurring during pregnancy or due to hormonal fluctuations) and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (dark spots left behind after acne or other skin injuries),\" Wizemann says. \"Individual results may vary when using these products, and consistent application (according to directions) along with sun protection is recommended for optimal benefits,\" she explains.', '\"But it\\'s essential to understand that completely eliminating dark spots may not always be possible.\"Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowHow do you fix dark spots on your face?Here\\'s how to fade hyperpigmentation, whether at home or heading to the dermatologist for a professional treatment:Commit to a dark spot corrector for at least one month. Topical dark spot correcting products can be effective, but “must be used as directed for at least four weeks to see results,\" explains former GH Beauty Lab Executive Director Birnur Aral, Ph.D.Wear SPF. “Strict sun protection is the best way to prevent hyperpigmentation,” says Janelle Vega, M.D., a dermatologist in Miami, Florida. A dark spot corrector must be used \"along with a broad-spectrum facial sunscreen SPF 30 or higher to allow it to work and prevent further damage,\" Aral says. Slather on face SPF every single day in any season and no matter your skin tone.', '\"Using SPF is still very important for darker skin tones,” adds Jenny Liu, M.D., an assistant professor of dermatology at the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis.Head to the derm. For stubborn spots, a dermatologist can offer faster, more high-tech solutions, like prescription or laser treatments. Visit one for yearly skin checks to ensure none of your spots are precancerous or cancerous.What\\'s the best way to use a dark spot corrector?Most importantly, use a dark spot corrector according to the instructions on the product packaging, especially regarding frequency, which can vary from once to twice daily or one or two times per week for products like peels. Note that depending on the product, it can take anywhere from four to twelve or more weeks of consistent use to see dark spot reduction.

acne\\nBaby acne\\nStubborn acne\\nAcne symptoms\\nWhat is acne\\nHow to treat acne in skin of color\\nFor people with skin of color, acne is often accompanied by dark spots or patches called hyperpigmentation.\", \"Fortunately, there are plenty of things people with skin of color can do at home to help clear their acne, as well as the dark spots that linger afterwards.\\nThe term “skin of color” refers to diverse skin types and complexions. It includes people of African, Asian, Latino, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Native American descent.People who have skin of color share some common skin-care concerns. Near the top of this list is how to get rid of acne and the dark spots that often appear when acne clears.The secret to seeing clearer skin lies in knowing what really works (and what doesn’t) when it comes to treating darker skin types. Below you’ll find 10 tips that science shows can lead to clearer skin.1. Treat both the acne and the dark spots.\\nMany people seek a dermatologist's help for the dark spots, which can last much longer than the acne. It's important to treat the acne, too.\", \"When you get rid of the acne, you eliminate what's causing the dark spots.\\nAcne and dark spots\\nDermatologists recommend treating acne and dark spots at the same time.\\n2. Prevent dark spots and scars by treating acne early.\\nStudies show that treating acne when it's just beginning can prevent acne from getting worse. If acne worsens, becoming moderate to severe before treatment begins, people with skin of color have a higher risk of developing:Spots and patches of darker skinKeloids, a type of raised scar3. Use acne products that work well in skin of color.\\nNot every acne product works well in skin of color. If you’re looking for products to treat mild acne, dermatologists recommend using products that contain one or more of the following ingredients.\\nA retinoid and benzoyl peroxide: This means buying two different products, but this combination works well in skin of color. The retinoid helps to unclog pores and reduce inflammation. It can clear pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads.\", \"A retinoid can also prevent new breakouts.Benzoyl peroxoide can remove the bacteria that cause acne. If you're worried about it causing light spots on your skin, don't be. That’s a myth. It won't. However, it will bleach clothing, sheets, pillow cases, and towels.To prevent benzoyl peroxide from irritating your skin, start with a product that contains 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. Products that contain more can cause dryness and flaking, which can worsen acne. If the 2.5% product irritates your skin, try using it every other day.\\nDo not pop pimples\\nIf you pick, pop, or squeeze acne, you increase your risk of getting a scar.\\nSalicylic acid: This active ingredient helps unclog pores and prevent new acne breakouts.Retinol: This can unclog pores and fade dark spots.You’ll find benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or retinol in acne products that you can buy without a prescription. Retinol is a type of retinoid. Another retinoid that may be helpful is adapalene gel 0.1%. The U.S.\", \"Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved it (brand name Differin gel), for sale without a prescription. 4. Make some changes if acne only appears on your forehead and temples.\\nIf acne only appears in these areas, your hair oil may be the cause. This is so common that there's actually a name for it—pomade acne.You may be able to clear this acne by making some changes. Options that dermatologists recommend to their acne patients include:Switch hair care products, using one that contains water or glycerin instead of oil.Use the hair oil only in the middle of your scalp and ends of your hair.If you continue to get breakouts, another option is to stop using these hair care products.5. Use skin care products that won't clog your pores.\\nLike hair oil, your skin-care products could be causing your breakouts. If you apply a product that contains oil such as cocoa butter or shea butter to your face, back, or chest, it can clog your pores.\", 'Clogged pores can lead to acne.To prevent skin care products from causing acne, use only products that are labeled “non-comedogenic” or “won’t clog pores.”\\nCocoa butter\\nThere’s absolutely no scientific evidence that cocoa butter can even out your skin tone, but it can cause acne.\\n6. Stop using heavy, oily makeups to cover dark marks.\\nWhile many women find this an effective way to hide blemishes, they often don’t realize that it’s also causing new blemishes.It’s okay to wear makeup if you choose mineral makeup or one that says “non-comedogenic.” Mineral makeup can do a great job of hiding dark spots.7. Be gentle with your skin.\\nDo you scrub your face to help get rid of acne blemishes? Are you convinced that popping a pimple or using strong soaps will lead to clearer skin? Hard as it is to believe, the truth is these things actually worsen acne.Science shows that what really works to clear acne is gentle skin care.', 'When caring for skin with breakouts, you want to:Use a mild cleanser that won\\'t clog your pores. (The label may say \"won\\'t clog pores\" or \"non-comedogenic.\")Apply the cleanser gently with your fingertips, and use only your fingertips to wash and rinse your face.Gently pat your skin dry with a clean towel.8. Wash caps and hats frequently.\\nWearing a baseball cap or anything else on your head without washing (or dry cleaning) it allows sweat, dirt, and oil to accumulate. This can cause acne to flare.9.', 'See a dermatologist before using any type of chemical peel, microdermabrasion, or laser therapy to treat your acne.\\nIf you have darkly pigmented skin, even the at-home versions of these acne treatments can cause side effects like permanent dark marks and light spots.In the right hands, however, these treatments can be effective for treating acne in skin of color.If you’re thinking about one of these treatments, you should see a doctor who specializes in treating the skin, such as a dermatologist. The dermatologist should frequently use this treatment in people who have skin of color. Be sure to ask how many people with skin of color the doctor has treated.10.

Carqueville says these ingredients block the enzyme that makes pigment. Vitamin C. This not only brightens the skin but it\\'s also an antioxidant, \"so it\\'s preventative and can be used when you\\'re in the sun.\" Retinol. \"It will thin the stratum corneum and thereby thin pigment and slough off extra layers of darker spots,\" she says.', 'Where do you put dark spot correctors in your skin care routine?In the morning, Carqueville recommends this order for your skin care routine:Cleanse.Apply dark spot-correcting product containing vitamin C, azelaic acid or kojic acid.Moisturize.Sunscreen.Makeup.The evening routine is the same, except the active ingredients in your evening routine should be hydroquinone or retinol, or both on an alternating basis. “I like to recommend people alternate retinol and hydroquinone every other day so they can be absorbed separately,\" Carqueville notes.Products to help with dark spotsNeutrogena Stubborn Marks PM TreatmentStubborn Marks PM Treatment$19.99Target$27.99CVS Photo$24.99WalgreensSize: 1 fl oz | Key ingredients: Retinol, vitamin C, benzoyl peroxide, glycerin, hyaluronic acidThis retinol-based product does all the work while you sleep — and you may even be able to skip the concealer in the morning.', 'While it’s mostly used to correct acne scarring, the brand says it also improves skin clarity and evens tone in just seven days.Cerave Skin Renewing Vitamin C SerumSkin Renewing Vitamin C Serum$24.99Target$29.99Ulta$17.95$28.99WalmartSize: 1 oz | Key ingredients: Vitamin C, glycerin, vitamin b5, ceramides, hyaluronic acid Protect against environmental damage all year round with this skin brightener, which contains 10% vitamin C, hydrating hyaluronic acid and ceramides.

Or how LlaMA by Meta kinda is but isnâ\\x80\\x99t?Itâ\\x80\\x99s developed 2 AI models in less than a year.Itâ\\x80\\x99s French.The founders are 3 researchers from DeepMind and Meta who aimed to beat GPT 3.5 by year-end.\\nThe big debate.Mistral believes (as do many others, myself included) that there are several concerns with closed AI approaches; businesses have to send sensitive data to it, only exposing the outputs doesnâ\\x80\\x99t help connect with other components (retrieval, structure inputs etc) and the data used to train the models are secret (so we assume it can do some things it perhaps hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been trained on).Now the bold stuff.â\\x80\\x9cMistral will offer the best technology in 4 yearsâ\\x80\\x9d.How?Theyâ\\x80\\x99ll take a more open approach to model development.Tighter integration with customersâ\\x80\\x99 workflows.Increase focus on data sources and control.Propose unmatched guarantees on security and privacy.Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a lot more detail in their deck on the above 4 points.As far as business focus goesâ\\x80¦â\\x80\\x9cOn the business side, we will provide the most valuable technology brick to the emerging AI-as-a-service industry that will revolutionise business workflows with generative AI.'"
